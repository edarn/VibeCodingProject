# Simple CRM

A lightweight, modern CRM system built for individuals and small teams who need a simple way to manage their business relationships without the complexity of enterprise solutions.

## Why Simple CRM?

Most CRM systems are bloated with features you'll never use. Simple CRM focuses on what matters:

- **Keep track of people** - Know who you've talked to, what you discussed, and what needs to happen next
- **Stay organized** - Group contacts by company, add notes, set reminders
- **Work together** - Invite your team and share everything instantly
- **Never lose data** - Archive instead of delete, backup with one click

## Features

### Contacts & Companies

Manage your business relationships with ease. Create companies, add contacts, and keep detailed notes on every interaction. Track roles, departments, and contact details all in one place.

### Candidates

Recruiting? Keep candidate information separate from your regular contacts. Upload resumes, add interview notes, and track your hiring pipeline.

### Tasks & To-Dos

Never forget a follow-up. Create tasks linked to specific contacts or companies, set due dates, and check them off as you go. See all your pending tasks in one unified view.

### Team Collaboration

Invite team members by email and instantly share all your CRM data. Everyone sees the same contacts, companies, and notes. Add your company logo for a branded experience.

### Data Protection

Made a mistake? No problem. Archived items can be restored anytime. Plus, export your entire database as a JSON file for safekeeping or migration.
